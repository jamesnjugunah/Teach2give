# CHALLENGE QUESTIONS

## 1. Password Authentication
 it is important to store datain a hashed format i.e the password is stored in an encrypted format that it is completely diffrent from the password entered by the user. this help that when even one gains access to the database the password cannot be visible.

 ## 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
 including multiple levels of authentications helps in securing users data since a fraudster would have to go through multiple levels of authentication to gain acces and which is less likely.

 ## 3. Balance Verification
 Balance verification is critical before withdrawal to avoid transaction failures i.e when the user check the balance before withdrawal he/she will know what amount not to exceed to avoid transaction failures.

 Fraudulent activities: Hackers could exploit the system by withdrawing more funds than available.

 ## 4. Daily Transaction Limit
 Daily transaction limits restrict the amount of money that can be withdrawn or transferred within a day. This serves multiple purposes:

 Fraud prevention: Limits reduce the potential loss in case of unauthorized access.

 Budget control: Helps users manage their spending.

 System integrity: Prevents excessive load on the banking system and ensures smooth operations.

 ## 5. Improvements
 Adding fraud detection features would involve tracking and analyzing various data points to identify suspicious activities. Key data to track might include:

 Transaction frequency: Unusual spikes in activity.

 Transaction amounts: Significant deviations from normal spending patterns.

 Geolocation data: Transactions from unexpected locations.

 Device information: New or unfamiliar devices accessing the account.

 Time of transactions: Transactions at odd hours. Implementing machine learning algorithms can help in identifying patterns and flagging potentially fraudulent activities for further investigation.
